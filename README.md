# dropletintherain

Figuring out what i want to do with this game. For some reason only the bottom right of the background is showing.
I think i either want the droplet to bouce of the sides and the player catch it with a bucket at the bottom of the screen. Or the droplet would fall and players will try to avoid any obstacles that will run in with the droplets.
